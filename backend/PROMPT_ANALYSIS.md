# LLM Prompt Analysis for Chat Interfaces

## Overview
Both `ChatbotTester.tsx` and `Chat.tsx` use the **same backend endpoint** (`/api/chatbot/chat`) and therefore have **identical RAG context retrieval and prompt construction**.

## RAG Context Retrieval Settings

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **LLM Model** | `llama3-8b-8192` | GROQ Llama 3 8B model |
| **Max QA Pairs** | `5` (top_k) | Maximum context entries retrieved |
| **Similarity Threshold** | `0.7` | Minimum similarity score for inclusion |
| **Temperature** | `0.7` | Response creativity level |
| **Max Tokens** | `500` | Maximum response length |
| **Context Format** | `Q: question\nA: answer` | How QA pairs are formatted |

## System Prompt

```
You are a helpful dental assistant chatbot for an AI dentist practice. 

Your role is to:
1. Answer questions about dental health, procedures, and general dentistry
2. Provide helpful information based on the knowledge base context provided
3. Be friendly, professional, and supportive
4. Always recommend consulting with a dentist for personalized medical advice

Guidelines:
- Use the provided context to answer questions when relevant
- If you don't know something, admit it and suggest contacting the dental office
- Never provide specific medical diagnoses or treatment recommendations
- Keep responses concise but informative
- Always end with encouragement to schedule an appointment if needed

Remember: You are not a replacement for professional dental care, but a helpful assistant.
```

## User Prompt Template (With Context)

```
Based on the following dental knowledge base context, please answer the user's question. Use the context as reference material - you don't need to use all of it, only the parts that are relevant to answering the question.

CONTEXT:
{context}

USER QUESTION: {query}

Instructions:
- Use relevant information from the context to provide an accurate answer
- You may combine information from multiple context entries if helpful
- If the context doesn't fully address the question, supplement with general dental guidance
- Always maintain a helpful, professional tone
- Suggest contacting the dental office for personalized advice when appropriate
```

## User Prompt Template (Without Context)

```
The user is asking: {query}

No specific context was found in the knowledge base. Please provide general dental guidance and suggest contacting the dental office for personalized advice.
```

## Example Context Retrieval

**Query**: "What are your office hours?"

**Retrieved QA Pairs** (2 found above threshold 0.7):
```
Q: What are your office hours?
A: Our office is open Monday through Friday from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM, and Saturday from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM. We are closed on Sundays and major holidays.

Q: What are your office hours?
A: Our office is open Monday through Friday from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM, and Saturday from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM. We are closed on Sundays and major holidays.
```

**Similarity Scores**: 0.727, 0.727
**Confidence Score**: 0.654

## Complete LLM Request

**Model**: `llama3-8b-8192`

**Messages**:
1. **System Role**: [System prompt above]
2. **User Role**: [User prompt with context above]

**Parameters**:
- `temperature`: 0.7
- `max_tokens`: 500

## Key Features

### ✅ Context Selection
- **Selective Usage**: Prompt explicitly states "you don't need to use all of it, only the parts that are relevant"
- **Smart Filtering**: Only includes QA pairs with similarity score ≥ 0.7
- **Top-K Limiting**: Maximum 5 QA pairs to prevent overwhelming the LLM

### ✅ Fallback Handling
- **No Context**: Graceful fallback when no relevant QA pairs found
- **Partial Context**: Can supplement with general guidance when context is incomplete
- **Error Handling**: Proper error responses when search fails

### ✅ Response Quality
- **Professional Tone**: Maintains dental office professionalism
- **Safety Guidelines**: Never provides medical diagnoses
- **Call-to-Action**: Encourages appointment scheduling
- **Personalization**: Suggests contacting office for specific needs

## Frontend Integration

Both chat interfaces receive the **same response structure**:

```json
{
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "response": "LLM generated response",
  "sources": [
    {
      "kb_id": 93,
      "question": "What are your office hours?",
      "category": "office_information", 
      "source": "clinic_specific",
      "similarity_score": 0.727
    }
  ],
  "confidence_score": 0.654,
  "response_time_ms": 1097,
  "search_results_count": 2
}
```

### Chat.tsx Features
- Shows source information in modal when clicked
- Displays confidence indicators
- Professional patient-facing interface

### ChatbotTester.tsx Features  
- Enhanced source display with categories and scores
- Confidence color coding (green/yellow/red)
- Admin testing interface with session stats

## RAG Pipeline Flow

1. **User Input** → Frontend (Chat.tsx or ChatbotTester.tsx)
2. **API Call** → `/api/chatbot/chat` endpoint
3. **Vector Search** → FAISS similarity search (k=5, threshold=0.7)
4. **Context Preparation** → Format QA pairs as context
5. **LLM Request** → GROQ Llama3 with system + user prompts
6. **Response Processing** → Extract response + calculate confidence
7. **Frontend Display** → Show response with sources

## Verification Results

- ✅ **RAG Retrieval**: Working correctly with 72 active QA pairs
- ✅ **Context Usage**: LLM uses relevant context selectively  
- ✅ **Prompt Quality**: Clear instructions for context usage
- ✅ **Source Attribution**: Proper tracking of which QA pairs influenced response
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when no context found
- ✅ **Performance**: ~1-2 second response times including vector search
